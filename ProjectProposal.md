Vehicle driving assistance system based on Beamng.drive simulator. 

I would like to implement one or more of the driving assistance feature like lane keeping, adaptive cruise control, accident prevention and etc. I will be using https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy library, which allows to control the vehicle in BeamNG.drive simulator and has plenty of device simulations like Lidar, Radar, GPS, etc.
